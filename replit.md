# MysticsHR Workspace

## Overview

MysticsHR is a comprehensive Human Resource Management System (HRMS) designed for Automystics Technologies Private Limited. Its primary purpose is to manage the entire employee lifecycle within an organization, supporting six distinct role-based access levels. The project aims to provide a robust, scalable, and user-friendly platform for HR operations, covering recruitment, onboarding, employee management, attendance, leave, performance, and exit processes. The system is built as a pnpm monorepo using TypeScript, ensuring modularity and maintainability.

## User Preferences

I prefer iterative development with clear communication on progress and potential changes. Please ask before making any major architectural decisions or significant code overhauls. I value detailed explanations for complex implementations.

## Running on Replit

Three artifacts run as separate services behind the shared proxy:
- `artifacts/mysticshr` (web, at `/`) — employee-facing HRMS app
- `artifacts/platform-admin` (web, at `/platform_admin/`) — platform admin console
- `artifacts/api-server` (api, at `/api`) — Express backend shared by both frontends

Start/restart each via the Replit workflow tool using its managed name (e.g. `artifacts/api-server: API Server`). The database schema is applied with `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`. Required env vars (`DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`) are already provisioned; optional integrations (email/SMTP, WhatsApp, Clerk) are not configured and degrade gracefully if unset.

## System Architecture

MysticsHR is structured as a pnpm monorepo. The core technology stack includes:
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Wouter.
- **Backend**: Express 5.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Authentication**: Clerk.
- **Validation**: Zod.
- **API Codegen**: Orval (generates React Query hooks and Zod schemas from OpenAPI spec).

The project's directory structure segregates `lib` for shared components like API specifications, client-side API hooks, Zod schemas, and database configurations. `artifacts` contains the deployable units for the API server and the React frontend.

**Key Architectural Decisions & Features:**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Supports `super_admin`, `hr_manager`, `hr_executive`, `hod`, `payroll_admin`, and `employee` roles, each with specific module access.
- **Modular Database Schema**: Designed with distinct tables for various HR functionalities (e.g., `employees`, `departments`, `designations`, `attendance_records`, `leave_applications`, `performance_cycles`, `helpdesk_tickets`).
- **Comprehensive API Design**: All API endpoints are under `/api` and cover CRUD operations, dashboard analytics, bulk imports, and workflow-specific actions for each HR module.
- **UI/UX**: Frontend pages are structured around HR workflows, including dashboards, employee directories, department/designation management, user administration, audit logs, and module-specific interfaces for recruitment, onboarding, shifts, attendance, leave, performance, helpdesk, and reporting. The UI utilizes Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for a consistent design.
- **Workflow Automation**: Includes automated processes for:
    - Onboarding: Auto-seeding tasks, calculating completion percentage, and generating ID cards (PDF with QR code).
    - Recruitment: Candidate stage auto-syncing based on interview/offer status, auto-creation of pre-onboarding records.
    - Leave/Permissions: Multi-level approval workflows, policy validations (balance, advance notice, blackout dates), and automatic balance updates.
    - Attendance: Automatic overtime calculation, regularization workflow, and HR override capabilities.
    - Performance: Lifecycle management for performance cycles, goal tracking, self/manager appraisals, and outcome computation with weighted scoring.
    - Exit: Auto-generation of clearance tasks, dual-approval for FNF, and auto-issuance of exit documents.
- **Document Generation**: Utilizes `pdf-lib` for generating dynamic PDFs (e.g., ID cards, offer letters, relieving letters) with template substitution.
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Features an analytics dashboard with KPIs (headcount, attrition, attendance), pre-built reports, a custom report builder, and a report scheduler.
- **Helpdesk Ticketing**: Implements ticket management with comments, SLA tracking, and role-based visibility.
- **Public API (v1)**: External integrations call `/api/v1/*` (employees, departments, attendance, payslips, leave-balances) using API keys in the format `mhr_live_<prefix>_<secret>` sent as `Authorization: Bearer …`. Keys carry granular scopes (`employees:read`, `departments:read`, `attendance:read`, `payslips:read`, `leave:read`); only the SHA-256 hash is persisted. Super admins manage keys at `/settings/api-keys`. OpenAPI spec served at `/api/openapi.json`, Swagger UI at `/api/docs`. Both successful calls and failed auth attempts are written to the audit log.
- **Field-level Auditing**: `employee_history` table records changes to employee profiles for audit trails.
- **Atomicity**: All critical mutations are wrapped in database transactions to ensure data consistency.
